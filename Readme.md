# Automatic Foursquare Check-ins

I like [Foursquare](http://4sq.com), but I keep forgetting the check-in at the office.  This repsitory allows for automatic check-is to a venue, based on MAC addresses.

### Registration interface

### How to use

There are two components, the registration interface and the networking scanner.

In order to get your users in the system, you'll need to launch the sinatra based registration interface found in the `bin/` folder.

Once your users are registered, run the `scan_network` script, also in the `bin/` folder in a `screen` or similar.  It'll keep looping and searching for new devices on your network, and check users into the venue on Foursquare at most once a day.

### Configuration

Configurations options can be found in `etc/config.yml.sample`.  You'll need to copy that file to `etc/config.yml`.  The database schema should be created automatically for you by [DataMapper](http://datamapper.org/).
